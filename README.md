# CRISPR_Validation


Code for CompBio coding Challange

Features:
- Barcodes of replicates and target sequence can be specfied
- Accounts for frameshift of barcode sequences (+203 additional sequences profiled)
- Avoids readingin entire fastq file

Nice to have:
- Account for mutations in target sequence and barcodes
- Make more scalable for larger and multible fastq file inputs
