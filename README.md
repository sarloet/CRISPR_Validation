# CRISPR_Validation

Code for CompBio coding Challenge.
Code is in .ipynb format for visualization purposes.

Features:

- Barcodes of replicates and target sequences can be specified and more barcodes added.
- Accounts for frameshifts in barcode sequences (+203 additional sequences profiled).
- Avoids reading the entire FASTQ file into memory.



Nice to have:

- Account for mutations in target sequences and barcodes.
- Make the code more scalable for larger and multiple FASTQ file inputs.
